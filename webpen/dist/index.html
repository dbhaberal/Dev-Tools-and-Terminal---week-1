    <h1 id="about">About me</h1>
    <p><img src="http://dotvio.com/deniz_about.jpg"> </p>
    <p>
  I have been teaching Turkish for Foreigners and English as a Second Language for over 4 years. My goal is to inspire a lifelong love of Turkish language in my students.</p>
  <p>I was born in Istanbul, but lived in different parts of Turkey and the world. After graduating from Girne American University in Cyprus, I moved to Vietnam and lived there for about 4 years. For the moment I live in Spain and I love living here, but I miss all my students in Vietnam.</p>
  <p>I started teaching online on iTalki in 2017, but due to work load I had to stop teaching on that platform for a couple of years. In 2020, I decided to be back to iTalki and spare more time for teaching online. </p>
  <p>With the materials I design for each topic, I make learning process easier for the students. Currently I am working on a podcast project as you can see on my website: TurkishPodcast.com</p>
  <p>My favorites:</p>
  <p><li>Food: Indian, Mexican, Turkish</li>
    <li>Color/s: Red & Black</li>
    <li>Movie: Horror, thriller, comedy</li>
    <li>Hobby: Web Design</li>
    <li>Animal: All</li>
  </p>
  <p>Free time activities:</p>
  <p>
    Watching movies, Netflix, Amazon Prime, driving, listening to music, creating websites, reading, traveling, hanging out with friends.
